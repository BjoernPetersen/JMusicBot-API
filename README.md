# JMusicBot-API

The API description for the JMusicBot written in Swagger.   
For every final version an Android client library is generated. The latest one can be found in the [androidClient](androidClient) directory.

## Documentation
The latest documentation can be found here: [documentation](https://felixgail.github.io/CircleCIArtifactProvider/index.html?vcs-type=github&user=BjoernPetersen&project=JMusicBot-API&build=latest&branch=master&filter=successful&path=root/app/docs/index.html&token=46dc7aefa69e32721cbdf9ec6e74645f52055c13).

## Other libraries
If the androidClient library doesn't fulfill your needs, you can also create a different client stub with the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) tool.
